The user's question is based on an image that is provided directly. Regions indicating specific areas of interest are drawn on the image, guiding the user's question. Regions are associated with detailed coordinates in the form of bounding boxes, represented as (x1, y1, w, h) with floating numbers ranging from 0 to 1. These values correspond to the top left x, top left y, width, and height of bounding boxes. \nPlease rate the helpfulness, relevance, accuracy, level of details of their responses. Each assistant receives an overall score on a scale of 1 to 10, where a higher score indicates better overall performance.\nPlease first output a single line containing only two values indicating the scores for Assistant 1 and 2, respectively. The two scores are separated by a space.\nIn the subsequent line, please provide a comprehensive explanation of your evaluation, avoiding any potential bias and ensuring that the order in which the responses were presented does not affect your judgment."},
